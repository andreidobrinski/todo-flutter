# Todo Flutter

A todo app built in Flutter.

## Why?

To build a todo app that can I can use at the gym. Each todo item will uncheck itself a week after it's been checked. This helps to keep track of all the exercises to be completed in a week, while being flexible about which day they get done.

Also to learn Dart and Flutter by building a practical application and to learn and contribute with other members of the Google Developer Group Toronto Study Jam.
